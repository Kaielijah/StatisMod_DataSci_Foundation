# üìå Probability & Statistics Cheatsheet: Laws, Formulas & When to Use Them

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Conditional Probability**
**Formula:**  
`P(A | B) = P(A ‚à© B) / P(B)`

**Use When:** You need to find the probability of an event **A given B has already occurred**. Used in medical testing, Bayesian inference, and reliability analysis.

**Limitations:** Assumes that event **B has nonzero probability** (i.e., `P(B) > 0`). Cannot be used when prior information about B is unavailable.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Law of Total Probability**
**Formula:**  
`P(A) = Œ£ P(A | B_i) P(B_i)` for all i

**Use When:** The probability of event A needs to be determined by considering all possible ways it can happen. Used in risk assessment, Bayesian modeling, and decision analysis.

**Limitations:** Requires a **mutually exclusive and exhaustive partition** of sample space. If the partitions overlap or do not fully cover A, results are incorrect.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Bayes‚Äô Theorem**
**Formula:**  
`P(A | B) = P(B | A) P(A) / P(B)`

**Use When:** You need to update prior probabilities based on new evidence (e.g., medical diagnosis, spam filtering, machine learning).

**Limitations:** Requires an accurate prior probability **`P(A)`** and **`P(B) > 0`**. Sensitive to poor prior estimates.

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Independent Events**
**Formula:**  
`P(A ‚à© B) = P(A) P(B)`

**Use When:** Two events **do not influence each other** (e.g., rolling two dice, independent experiments).

**Limitations:** Does not apply to dependent events. Wrongly assuming independence can lead to incorrect conclusions.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Expectation (Mean) & Variance**
**Formulas:**  
- **Expectation:** `E[X] = Œ£ x P(X=x)` (Discrete), `E[X] = ‚à´ x f(x) dx` (Continuous)
- **Variance:** `Var(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2]`

**Use When:** You need the **average value** (expectation) or **spread** (variance) of a random variable. Used in finance, quality control, and statistics.

**Limitations:** Assumes existence of **finite mean and variance**. **Heavy-tailed distributions (e.g., Cauchy)** may not have finite variance.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Moment Generating Functions (MGFs)**
**Formula:**  
`M_X(t) = E[e^(tX)]`

**Use When:** Finding **all moments (mean, variance, etc.)** of a distribution efficiently. Used in statistical proofs and CLT applications.

**Limitations:** Not all distributions have MGFs (e.g., Cauchy distribution). Requires convergence for all t.

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Chi-square, t, and F Distributions**
‚úî **Chi-square (`œá¬≤_n`)**: Used in **hypothesis testing**, goodness-of-fit tests.  
‚úî **t-distribution (`t_n`)**: Used when **sample size is small**, and population variance is unknown.  
‚úî **F-distribution (`F_{m,n}`)**: Used to compare **two variances** (ANOVA, regression).

**Limitations:** Requires normality assumptions for accurate results. Sensitive to outliers and sample size.

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ Probability Distributions Overview**
| **Distribution** | **Type** | **Formula Highlights** | **When to Use** | **Limitations** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bernoulli** | Discrete | One trial, 2 outcomes (success/failure) | Single event success/failure (coin toss) | Only valid for binary outcomes |
| **Binomial** | Discrete | `P(X = k) = C(n, k) p^k (1 - p)^(n - k)` | Number of successes in n trials | Assumes **independent** trials |
| **Poisson** | Discrete | `P(X = k) = (e^(-Œª) Œª^k) / k!` | Rare event occurrences (calls in an hour) | Assumes independent events, constant rate |
| **Normal** | Continuous | `N(Œº, œÉ¬≤)` | CLT, real-world processes (heights, errors) | Sensitive to outliers |
| **Exponential** | Continuous | `P(X ‚â§ x) = 1 - e^(-Œªx)` | Time until next event (reliability, queues) | Assumes memoryless property |
| **Gamma** | Continuous | Generalization of exponential | Waiting times, reliability | Only valid for positive values |
| **t-distribution** | Continuous | `t = Z / sqrt(U/n)` | Small sample hypothesis testing | Heavy tails, sensitive to small samples |
| **Chi-square** | Continuous | Sum of squared normal variables | Variance testing, goodness-of-fit | Requires normality assumption |
| **F-distribution** | Continuous | Ratio of two `œá¬≤` distributions | Comparing variances, ANOVA | Highly skewed, sensitive to sample size |
